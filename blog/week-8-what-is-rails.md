Blog: What is Ruby on Rails?

According to RubyonRails.org, Ruby on Rails (rails) is

"an open-source web framework thatâ€™s optimized
for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you
write beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration."

Um. What?

Before I go any further, I guess I should say that my current, uninformed guess is that Rails is is a framework or library that extends Ruby. I guess in my mind Rails is to Ruby as jQuery is to Javascript. Let's see if I'm correct!

According to the RailsApps project, http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html, "Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language", otherwise known as a Ruby Gem. Looks like my hunch is right on the money!

It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson and is licensed under the MIT license, meaning it's free and open-source. Additionally, Rails was developed with the DRY concept in mind, which helps with scalability, and means fewer bugs to debug.

Learning Rails means learning how to use Rails conventions (I suppose, as you would with any other programming language) and its API (as you would with, say, the Google Maps API). It combines Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Most of my favourite things! (Javascript is not currently my favourite thing)

The RailsApps project also mentions the community that supports Rails. I guess it's like the WordPress community that I'm already a part of - people share their time and expertise to help others and contribute to the core, as well as extending the capabilities.

So, why Rails? A lot of it seems to be about convention and community.

"The advantage of establishing conventions might seem obvious, but when Rails was released in 2004, web development was dominated by PHP, which lent itself to idiosyncratic code produced by solo webmasters, and Java frameworks such as Struts, which were often seen as burdened by an excess of structure."

I must admit this quote made me smile. As a solo and rogue webmistress with thousands of lines of my own idiosyncratic PHP code (and having read through hundreds of lines of other people's idiosyncratic PHP code!), I can see how conventions are desirable, and necessary for scalabilty.

As RailsApps project says, there's the "Rails way" (and, I imagine, the wrong way).

So, from what I understand, Rails is going to make my life easier as I create applications. It will do that by providing me with a framework that has well-established conventions, is based on DRY code, and combines HTML, CSS and Ruby into something quite cohesive. I look forward to using it!
