Blog: Research your thinking style

I scored highly as an Abstract Sequential thinker (48), with the other thinking styles fairly evenly spread (in the 20s)

So. What does that mean?

Apparently Abstract Sequential learners work best when they:
- have reading references and expert sources.

- are sure of themselves.

- follow traditional procedures.

- have time to learn material thoroughly.

- can work alone.

- are respected for intellectual ability.

- write analytical essays.

- rely on lecture notes and written materials.

- do library research.

AS thinkers are quite happy to do self-directed learning, but don't like to appear uninformed.

I agree that some of these statements reflect my learning style, but there's something quite major left off this list! I really do like to learn by doing. I like to read, or watch a video, then do it myself. I can't work with theory alone, I need to put it into practise. I don't fully understand something until I've done it myself.

A good example was chemistry class in high school. I'm not great at chemistry. We were balancing equations. The teacher explained, and showed an example on the board. We did an example together, as a class. I thought I understood what to do - it made sense.

We tried another equation, with a partner. I still thought I was okay. It wasn't until I got home and attempted my homework did I find that I was completely lost. Turns out, not doing something on my own, with an expert nearby to ask questions, meant I didn't understand a concept that was difficult to me.

That's why I'm quite wary of working as a group -- I really want to make sure that I understand something myself, because I'm not always going to have a group of smarties around me.
