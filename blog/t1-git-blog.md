## What are the benefits of version control?

Version control is a life-saver for coders. Imagine, you're coding away, creating something cool an it's working really well. An hour later, it's broken! Nothing works! How on earth are you going to pin-point what's causing the problem?

Enter version control! By commiting (creating a 'checkpoint') early and often, and writing good messages describing what you did at each point, your debugging job is now so much easier than reading through hundreds or thousands of lines of code.

Even better, you can 'roll back' your work at any one of those checkpoints you created. Bliss!

## How does git help you keep track of changes?

Git allows you to create commits, which are like a checkpoint in a video game. Git can show you the changes that occured with each check point, which makes debugging much easier.

In order to commit your changes, you need to write a commit message explaining what you did. This is invaluable to future-you and/or your team-mates, who may wonder why exactly you did what you did!


##Why use GitHub to store your code?

If you use GitHub, your code is stored in the cloud, and your team-mates can collaborate with you easily, without creating horrible conflicts. GitHub can show you all the changes that were made with any commit, and who made them. This makes life much easier -- as well as creating a sense of accountability, if you find something funky in someone else's code, you can go and ask them about it! Hopefully, they'll explain their thought process, or you could suggest another way to get the job done.
