I'm really happy about the way Dev Academy is run. I really like the idea of a working environment where you, the student, are working your way through problems. Honestly, people can lecture at me all they like, but none of it is going to actually connect properly in my mind until I do it with my own hands.

There are a few things I'm...apprehensive about.

It's funny that Shereef talked about some students simultaneously having impostor syndrome, but also being haunted by perceived mediocrity. This is pretty much how I'm feeling at the moment. There's some things I'm great at, and I worry that I'm going to be really bored! There's some things I'm really apprehensive about (Javascript, algorithms), because I know that I am NOT great at those things.

In the past few years I've learned a lot about learning. Funnily enough, it wasn't until I went to teacher training school that I learned about learning.

When I was younger, I was fortunate in being natrually talented at most academic subjects. Because I got good marks without trying, I never really learned to work hard. I never learned to take pride in progress, and feel that awesome feeling that comes with seeing your hard work pay off.

In cases where I found I wasn't naturally good at something (hello, maths), I simply decided not to try. I dropped the subject as soon as I could, and focused on what I was good at. It's a shame, really. Looking back, I wasn't absolutely terrible at maths or science, and I could have become moderately proficient if I had put in the hard work.

So back to teacher training. Every week we did two teaching sessions -- one in a classroom of 15 students, and one with just a single student. I was confident about my first session. It was a one-on-one, and because I had tutored students before, I thought I had this down.

Immediately after I taught my lesson, my working group gathered in our supervisor's office for feedback. I got TORN. TO. SHREDS. I never saw it coming! My supervisor pointed out every single minute mistake that I made, and I was devastated. I'd never had that sort of feedback before in my life.

As it turns out (and those of you who are wiser than I was then are probably nodding along), that feedback was exactly what I needed to hear. Because it was that week that I learned that it's okay to make mistakes, and that you should implement the feedback you're given, and take pride in your improvements. It was humbling, and sometimes I feel like I still need more reminders of that lesson (both the one I gave to the student, and the one the supervisor gave me).

So, it's my goal during Dev Academy to continue to learn about hard work, improvement, and humility.

It's pretty nerve-wracking admitting this, but I will say that it's easier doing this online before we meet in the classroom. I do rather like a soft, online introduction to people before we get together, they look me in the eye, and point out what I've done wrong!

So, Dev Academy... keep me honest, keep me humble, and please help me to work hard.
